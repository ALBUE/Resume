# Resume  
## A little about who I am.  
I was born and raised in Ketchikan, Alaska.  I live in Anchorage.  
Retired, I live with my wife here in East Anchorage.  

## My hobbies and pastimes.  
I am a retired auditor.  
I enjoy jogging and keeping care of myself.  
I read daily.  
I work on my investments.  
I enjoy programming using C++  

## GitHub hopefully will assist me in developing my C++ program  
My C++ program contains several stocks I own. 
It includes dividends and other pertinent information by stock.  
I have an additional C++ program that appends one C++ program to another.  
And a third C++ program with a simple pie graph.  

## What I am looking for:  
I hope someone can steer me to more graphs in C++, perhaps better ones.  
My pie chart is rudimentary.  Anyone suggest where I can code in a better one?
