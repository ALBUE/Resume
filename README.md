# Resume  
## A little about who I am.  
I was born and raised in Ketchikan, Alaska, the son of Norwegian immigrants.      
I live with my wife in East Anchorage.  

## My hobbies and pastimes.  
I am retired.  
I enjoy jogging, keeping care of my family and myself.  
I read daily.  
I work on my investments.  
I program with C++.  
I am not too good at C++, but I enjoy studying and using the language.    

## GitHub hopefully will assist me in developing my C++ program  
My C++ program contains several stocks. 
It includes dividends and other pertinent information.  
I have an additional C++ program that appends one C++ program to another.  
And a third C++ program with a simple pie graph.  

## What I am looking for:  
I hope someone can steer me to more graphs in C++, perhaps better ones.  
My pie chart is rudimentary.  Anyone suggest where I can find better ones?

## Files   
  
C++ file. Shows stocks and other information about them.
stock_tracking1 - Copy.txt  
A stock selecting Menu. This C++ file will become part of the stock tracking file, above.
simpleMenu.txt  
A C++ Pie Chart.
It contains stock data, presented in pie chart form. 
(I'd like to get fancier pie charts or other charts in C+.
I hope the Community can suggest something.)
PieChart.txt  
Below is a C++ program that will append two files.
APPEND TWO FILES 9_2019.txt  
Below is text file for appending one file to another. I use it to test my APPEND TWO FILES program.

Below is another text file for appending one file to another. Used for testing, as above.
