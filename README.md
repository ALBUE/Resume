# Resume  
## A little about who I am.  
I was born and raised in Ketchikan, Alaska, the son of Norwegian immigrants.      
I live with my wife in East Anchorage.  

## My hobbies and pastimes.  
I am retired.  
I enjoy jogging, keeping care of my family and myself.  
I read daily.  
I work on my investments.  
I enjoy programming using C++.  

## GitHub hopefully will assist me in developing my C++ program  
My C++ program contains several stocks I own. 
It includes dividends and other pertinent information, by stock.  
I have an additional C++ program that appends one C++ program to another.  
And a third C++ program with a simple pie graph.  

## What I am looking for:  
I hope someone can steer me to more graphs in C++, perhaps better ones.  
My pie chart is rudimentary.  Anyone suggest where I can find better ones?
